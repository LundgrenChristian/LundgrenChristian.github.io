        <p> 
            Game design and programming graduate. Through iterative design processes like scrum, I have learned how to polish and test a game until it is finished.
            Working in different teams I've learned how to collaborate and speak freely and honestly and perhaps most importantly listen and take in teammates' ideas.

            I am well experienced in Unity and with scripting. I know Unreal Engine's visual scripting and have a basic knowledge of its c++ API. 
            I have learnt different algorithms such BST and about their varying time complexities. I know how to use different design patterns such as State machines and Behavior trees.
            On my free time I'm working on a multiplayer mobile game with my pal.
