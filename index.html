        Orthogonal movement 2023-06-05
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of an input system for an arena mobile game I’m developing called Arenan. (Found in the projects tab.)
    </p>
    <p>
        When a finger is placed on the screen the character walks in the direction the player swipes their finger. When the player stops touching the screen the character stays still. If the player stops touching the screen while swiping in a direction, a swipe input is registered and an character specific ability is fired off. A second active ability is fired off when taping the screen quickly. A 3rd ability is activated passively if requirements are met.
        Right now, ranged abilities are angled towards the player orthogonally. And melee abilities take affect all around the caster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Positives:
        One positive is that we don’t need a joystick like movement input tracker as often used in other games such as brawl stars and stumble guys.
        You can input anywhere on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Negatives:
        Using the system as it is now. Hitting abilities is harder because you must zig zag to get to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Potential solutions:
        Some solutions might be to allow non orthogonal spells but that makes ranged attacks hard to dodge if you are hitting an enemy from an upward/downward angle because you can only dodge up or down.
        Another solution might be to increase the area of effect ranged abilities have. For example, instead of shooting one arrow a cone of arrows is fired.
        Guaranteed hit abilities, that makes it easier to land the other abilities. Much like stuns in other games do it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional notes:
        I think this input system would work good in a super smash bros side view format. Because avoiding in the upwards or downward direction in fighting games are more punishing because of jumping and falling leaves you vulnerable. And because of the game's limited number of platforms where you can walk unencumbered.
