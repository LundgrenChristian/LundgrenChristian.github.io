    <div>


        <p>
            I recently finished my bachelor's degree in Game Design and Programming at Uppsala university Campus Gotland. My interest in creating has led me to explore new things.
            From earlier editing videos and playing videogames for fun to eventually enrolling in university, following my passion for games catapulted me into the creator's seat.
            It's a lot of fun prototyping ideas and seeing them completed is much more gratifying than I expected.
            During my studies I have had the pleasure of working with people whom I now call friends. My biggest takeaway is to communicate and to be open to new ideas.

        <p>
            I am experienced in Unity and with scripting. I am well versed in Unreal Engine's visual scripting and have a basic knowledge of its c++ API.
            I have learnt different algorithms such BST and about their varying time complexities. I know how to use different design patterns such as State machines and Behavior trees.
            On my free time I'm developing a multiplayer mobile game with my pal.
